v.2.0

# Unico-Smart-Contract

Due to a large number of complex data structures powering our ecosystem (secondary market trades, MHN protocol, etc), we have decided to split our Smart Contract in two sub-contracts, in line with best practices. You can inspect the contracts at the following addresses: 

https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xa2778dcd6a69ac6a25a356c036c5014987c10415#code (Contract Source Code Verified)
https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x0d2fbe65925c624c7b023267b447de0dbb9fd49a#code (Contract Source Code Verified)

We are testing all functionalities and soon as possible we’ll release a simple web interface.

PAST

Before the Web, information was scarce. People were looking for entertainment and valuable objects in the physical world. Music was coming out of vinyl records, autographs were signed on real paper, collectible stickers could be stuck on the wall, sports memorabilia smelled like sweat and dust. Value came from ownership and scarcity.

PRESENT

Nowadays, fun is digital and we are flooded with information. Most online content is free and shareable. We want digital assets, products and services and expect fast, frictionless, mobile management of them. Collecting is a strong uptrend in the physical world. The market is ripe for digital collectibles, but it is lacking a notion of digital scarcity.

FUTURE

Enter UNICO. We create provable digital scarcity by linking a piece of digital content to a fixed number of access tokens that we issue on the Ethereum blockchain. In this way we can turn premium digital content (images, videos, 3D models, immersive AR/VR tours, games, …) into limited-edition, blockchain-certified collectibles.

ME HERE NOW

The most valuable collectibles are not just rare, they are unique! Suppose you bring your favourite Eminem vinyl record to a concert, and you get Eminem to write on it: “To my friend John Smith, met at Cincinnati concert on 10/12/2017”. Eminem has certified that you were at his concert, so your collectible has increased in value. UNICO has created a similar authentication protocol for digital collectibles. We call it ME, HERE and NOW (MHN), or Proof of Attendance.

We are working on:

    //HERE, ME, NOW multisign implementation
    //Primary market support for ETH and UNI
    //Discount based on UNI wallet

    //Give in gift some license to royalty addresses (price 0)
    //Add multiple HereMeNowExtension
    //Multiple Here/Me/Now sign (for example for recurring events)
    //Selling Fee: seller must have some UNI to sell
